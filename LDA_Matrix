doc1 = "dream. His face — whose bronzed hues and bold features are strongly defined against the soft satin of the pillow which supports his head— is turned to the light, and you discover that Brother Caleb is sleeping with his eyes wide open and teeth set firmly together. Brother Caleb's face, with sunken cheeks, wide mouth and thin lips, forehead widening over the brows, and eyes bulging from their lids, does not present a pleasant picture at any time, but now, agitated by the terrors of a dream, and mocked by the very contrast of the silken pillow and velvet curtain, it is as hideous as the phantom of a nightmare. And yet he is sleeping there, the owner of the splendid mansion, like an unsightly kernel, within a rich, luxurious shell. He is so very, very rich. A bachelor, too, with no care of wife or child upon his soul. For him, a thousand, and ten thousand slaves, are waiting ever— not slaves with black faces, and owned by the life-time merely — but slaves of all hues and races, whose services he may purchase with his pieces of gold, and his slips of bank note paper. There is something grand in the idea. Here sleeps a Rich Man who has no care, save that involved in the legal enjoyment of his appetites. His money — how gained, where acquired, is not your business — his money, is but the embodied toil of some ten thousand slaves; the work of ten thousand common people, petrified into bank notes and brick walls. This money would make ten thousand poor men happy. This money would give educa tion to twenty thousand poor men's children This money, properly applied, would deprive the penitentiary and the gallows of many a victim, and very likely turn every victim into an honest man. But away with thoughts like these. Who talks of depriving Brother Caleb of his — PROPERTY? Property, however won, is defended by Law, and sanctified by Religion. Whatever robbery Property may choose to commit, it is your part to remain silent. But let any ragged wretch, pilfer only one of Property's bank notes, and you shall see, forth with, that Property is soundly backed by Judge and Penitentiary. One day I saw a crowd of meanly dressed women, holding children by their hands, go sadly up the marble steps of a Bank. That bank had failed, and these women and children were by its failure, deprived of the very means of life. There was no law for the woman and the child; there was no Judge, bold enough to try these robbers of the Bank. Another day, I heard, that some thief — or band of thieves — had stolen seventy thousand dollars, from the President of a bank. At once the whole community was in uproar. The press rung out, the terrible theft, from Maine to the Rio Grande. Judges and juries were ready to try the thieves, and Courts sat week"

I will not sit among ill women, no, not in heaven; for their mind is not my mind, nor their soul my soul. I have stood, unbeknown, at my window, and heard their talk.’ For some time she was unable to say any more, but made signs to him that she had not done. At last she recovered her breath, and bade him look at the picture. It was the portrait he had made of her when they were young together, and little thought to part so soon. He held it in his hands and looked at it, but could scarce see it. He had left it in fragments, but now it was whole. ‘They cut it to pieces, Gerard. But see, Love mocked at their knives. ‘I implore thee with my dying breath, let this picture hang ever in thine eye. ‘I have heard that such as die of the plague, unspotted, yet after death spots have been known to come out; and, oh, I could not bear thy last memory of me to be so. Therefore, as soon as the breath is out of my body, cover my face with this handkerchief, and look at me no more till we meet again, 'twill not be so very long. O promise.’ ‘I promise,’ said Gerard, sobbing. ‘But look on this picture instead. Forgive me; I am but a woman. I could not bear my face to lie a foul thing in thy memory. Nay, I must have thee still think me as fair as I was true. Hast called me an angel once or twice; but be just! did I not still tell thee I was no angel, but only a poor simple woman, that whiles saw clearer than thou because she looked but a little way, and that loves thee dearly, and never loved but thee, and now with her dying breath prays thee indulge her in this, thou that art a man.’ ‘I will. I will. Each word, each wish is sacred.’ ‘Bless thee! Bless thee! So then the eyes that now can scarce see thee, they are so troubled by the pest, and the lips that shall not touch thee to taint thee, will still be before thee, as they were when we were young and thou didst love me.’ ‘When I did love thee, Margaret! Oh, never loved I thee as now.’ ‘Hast not told me so of late.’ ‘Alas! hath love no voice but words? I was a priest; I had charge of thy soul; the sweet offices of a pure love were lawful; words of love imprudent at the least. But now the good fight is won, ah me! Oh my love, if thou hast lived doubting of thy Gerard's heart, die not so: for never was woman loved"
doc3 = "but by distribution. To the primary sound we may shut our ears; but the reverberation of it in echoes is irresistible. On his way back, Midwinter's one desire had been to find Allan up, and to speak to him immediately. His one hope now was to gain time to contend with the new doubts and to silence the new misgivings—his one present anxiety was to hear that Allan had gone to bed. He turned the corner of the house, and presented himself before the men smoking their pipes in the back garden. As soon as their astonishment allowed them to speak, they offered to rouse their master. Allan had given his friend up for that night, and had gone to bed about half an hour since. “It was my master's particular order, sir,” said the head footman, “that he was to be told of it if you came back.” “It is myparticular request,” returned Midwinter, “that you won't disturb him.” The men looked at each other wonderingly, as he took his candle and left them. Appointedhours for the various domestic events of the day were things unknown at Thorpe-Ambrose. Irregular in all his habits, Allan accommodated himself to no stated times (with the solitary exception of dinner-time) at any hour of the day or night. He retired to rest early or late, and he rose early or late, exactly as he felt inclined. The servants were forbidden to call him; and Mrs. Gripper was accustomed to improvise the breakfast as she best might, from the time when the kitchen fire was first lighted, to the time when the clock stood on the stroke of noon. Towards nine o'clock on the morning after his return, Midwinter knocked at Allan's door; and on entering the room, found it empty. After inquiry among the servants, it appeared that Allan had risen that morning before the man who usually attended on him was up, and that his hot water had been brought to the door by one of the housemaids, who was then still in ignorance of Midwinter's return. Nobody had chanced to see the master, either on the stairs or in the hall; nobody had heard him ring the bell for breakfast as usual. In brief, nobody knew anything about him, except what was obviously clear to all—that he was not in the house. Midwinter went out under the great portico. He stood at the head of the flight of steps considering in which direction he should set forth to look for his friend. Allan's unexpected absence added one more to the disquieting influences which still perplexed his mind. He was in the mood in which trifles irritate a man, and fancies are all-powerful to exalt or depress his spirits. The sky was cloudy; and the wind blew in puffs from the south— there was every prospect, to weather-wise eyes, of coming rain. While Midwinter was still hesitating, one of the grooms passed him on the drive below. The man proved, on being"

The little woman, who did not seem as much offended as might have been expected of her at this somewhat free-and-easy manner of being addressed by your omnibus-driver, bundled in, and bundled the baby in, and bundled in the little girl, and when they had all bundled into a seat together Eunice saw that it was Marthy Ann. “Got the young uns shod?” roared 23, through the loop-hole. “Good gracious me, Dan! I 'm not deef, and there 's no need of tellin' the passengers all as I went into town for,” said Marthy, blushing as prettily as ever a little woman of her size blushed in the world. “Though I didbuy the baby a pair of red ankle-ties, and, thinks says I, I 'll give 'em to her to carry and keep her still, and what should she do but try to swallow 'em, and one of 'em sticking down her throat like to strangle her, and when I pulled it out, there it is, all turned violet in a streak across the toes, — the mischief!” “Give her t' other,” suggested 23. “Make her suck 'em both alike.” “I thought of that,” said Marthy; “a violet foxing would n't be bad.” Marthy was so grave and pretty and happy about this bit of chatter, and she seemed, as she used to seem, so fond of her new baby, and 23 so fond of her, that Eunice felt her heart warmed through by Marthy almost as much as had poor Nixy, listening to her lullaby on the kitchen lounge. She drew her veil and watched the children behind it; the little girl sat close beside her, and attracted by the whiteness of her hand, which lay, half gloved, upon her lap, she put up her little finger and felt it over shyly. Eunice raised the child's hand gently to her lips (wondering if such a happy little matron as Marthy would be quite willing that she should kiss her child), and slipped a tiny silver piece (as large as the hand would hold) into it, as she laid it back. “Hush!” she whispered, “can you tell your mother something for me, if I ask you to?” The child nodded, — a dumpy little nod, but emphatic. “And not tell her — mind! — till I have got out of the omnibus?” The little girl shook her head shrewdly. “I want you then to tell her, — and you can have the silver, — I want you to tell your mother, God bless her, and God bless the baby, and God bless you!” “How funny! What for?” “Because your mother is a good woman — a good woman; and once, long ago, she was kind to a poor little girl to whom nobody else was kind — but just your father there; and so I want you to tell her, for it is easy for you to remember:"
doc5 = "suppose?” “I don't know but I might, sir,” answered Ithuel, rolling his eyes around him, curious to ascertain what the other would be at. “I don't know but I might remember, on a pinch, sir; though, to own the truth, my memory is none of the most desperate best.” “Well, then, where was it? Recollect that the life of your late friend, Raoul Yvard, may depend on your answer.” “I want to know!—Well, this Europe isa curious part of the world, as all must admit, that come from Ameriky. What has Captain Rule done now, sir, that he stands in such jeopardy?” “You know that he is convicted as a spy; and my orders are to have him executed, unless we can get his lugger. Then, indeed, we may possibly show him a little favour; as we do not make war so much on individuals, as on nations.” Cuffe would probably have been puzzled to explain the application of his own sentiment to the case before him; but, presuming on his having to deal with one who was neither very philosophical nor logical himself, he was somewhat indifferent to his own mode of proceeding, so that it effected the object. Ithuel, however, was not understood. Love for Raoul, or the lugger, or, indeed, for anything else, himself excepted, formed no part of his character; while hatred of England had got to be incorporated with the whole of his moral system; if such a man could be said to have a moral system at all. He saw nothing to be gained by serving Raoul, in particular; though this he might have done did nothing interfere to prevent it; while he had so strong an aversion to suffering the English to get le Feu-Follet, as to be willing even to risk his own life, in order to prevent it. His care, therefore, was to accomplish his purpose, with the least hazard to himself. “And, if the lugger can be had, sir, you intend to let Captain Rule go?” he asked, with an air of interest. “Ay, we maydo that; though it will depend on the admiral. Can you tell us where you left her, and where she probably now is?” “Captain Rule has said the first, already, sir. He told the truth, about that, before the court. But, as to telling where the lugger is now, I 'll defy any man to do it! Why, sir, I 've turned in, at eight bells, and left her, say ten or fifteen leagues dead to leeward of an island, or a light-house, perhaps; and on turning out at eight bells, in the morning, found her, just as far to windward of the same object. She 's as oncalculating craft as I ever put foot aboard of.” “Indeed!” said Cuffe, ironically; “I do not wonder that her captain's in a scrape.” “Scrape, sir!—The Folly is nothing buta scrape. I 've tried my hand at keeping her reck'nin'.” “You!” “Yes, sir, I; Ithuel Bolt, that 's"

One day, when he had been unusually gloomy in his utterances, he handed me a letter, saying, “Read that.” It was from his sister, and ran, as nearly as I can recollect, as follows: — “ My dear Brother,— Yours of the 10th is received. I am now so accustomed to your sarcastic style, that I always know what to expect when I open one of your epistles. I wish you joy of your — well, I must say ournew cousin, though I am sorry you did not let me know of the discovery before telling him.He must be gaucheand unpresentable in a degree; but then, I suppose, there 's no likelihood of his ever getting into our set.It is time your schooling was finished, so that I might have you for awhile as my chevalier.Between ourselves, I 'm rather tired of going about with” (here the word “Mamma” had evidently been written and then blotted out) “Mrs. Penrose. Not but what she continues to improve, — only, I am never certain of her not committing some niaiserie,which quite puts me out. However, she behaves well enough at home, and I hope you will overcome your prejudice in the end, for my sake. When you know as much about Society as I do, you will see that it 's always best to smooth over what 's irrevocable. People are beginning to forget the scandal, since that affair of Denbigh has given them something else to talk about. We were at Mrs. Delane's ball on Wednesday; I made her put on blue cut velvet, and she did not look so bad. Mrs. Vane nodded, and of course shewas triumphant. I think Papa gives me the credit for all that has been done, — I 'm sure I deserve it. It 's a race between Mrs. P. and myself which shall have the new India shawl at Stokes's; but I shall get it, because Mrs. P. knows that I could teach her to blunder awfully as well as to behave correctly, and woulddo it, in spite of Papa's swearing, if she drives me to desperation. By the by, he has just come into the room, and says, `You are writing to the cub, as usual, I suppose, Matilda.' So there you have him, to the life.” There was much more, in the same style. I must have colored, with offended pride, on reading the opening lines, for on looking up, involuntarily, I saw my cousin smile, but so frankly and pleasantly that it instantly healed the wound his sister made. I confess the letter disgusted me; but it was written by my own cousin also, and I did not dare to express to her brother what I felt. I handed the"
doc7 = "rashly. It is science against science. Charge and repel— mine and countermine — plot and counterplot, until the strife is over, to subside into reminiscences of the game, contestants proving on the ends of the fingers that, if so and so had been done, thus and so would have been the result. Ah, happy the hours, in the years gone by, spent in this delightful way — and so sinless, so peaceful, so grateful! The memory, busy with the past, recalls scenes in which we participated, many years ago, before this mould accrued upon our beard, and when the hair bore no traces of accumulating silver — when the band was large that met with us in gladness and joy, now, alas! thinned by the changes of time and the vicissitudes of circumstance, involving separation, and worse alienation, through worldly selfishness and the hard-heartedness that money brings with it. Some may say, like the “detestable Jones,” that such memories are vain; that the enjoyments they recall were frivolities better forgotten; that sin found an entrance to the soul through the portals of easy friendship, and the better man was lulled to sleep by the insidious influences of pleasure; but it is pleasant to recall them, nevertheless, and in dreams of joy enact the scenes anew that gave delight then. Whist thus has, like Moses' rod, struck the rock, and memory has poured out like a flood; p676-324 the table is vacant; the guests have flown; not a pasteboard is to be seen; the wind howls by the window and the chimney; and we sit alone by the fire crooning o'er thoughts of lang syne. Regardingoysters, these delightful esculents enter so largely into the comforts and happinesses of life, that a word in their praise may not be amiss. No entertainment is complete without oysters. Men bet oysters; women dote upon oysters; children cry for oysters. Before the softening influence of oysters, human austerity bends, and kindness irradiates features before dark with clouds. Their odor is grateful to the nostrils as the odor of virtue is to the inward sense; we inhale the steamy and savory effluence from the kitchen as a harbinger of pleasant tastes; fancy burns in anticipation of fancy roasts, or indulges in stupendous imaginings of stews, and poesy winds its shell — an oyster-shell— in sounding the praise of oysters. Ruddy Margaret, as she bears the tureen to the table, the epicurean censer, steaming with holy incense to the deity of appetite, becomes invested with new interest. She looks, maugre her “Cork-red” cheeks, angelic amid the misty vapors of an oyster-stew. We draw around the board, happy in gustatory anticipations, never to be disappointed, and uncover (the oyster-dish) in reverence for the occasion, a meet grace before oysters. And participation does not pall, like other pleasures; — we ponder, and dream, and poetize, over our bowl, as the ancients did over their bowl of wine, and are as loth to leave it. But there is no poison"
doc8 = "the other sisters you wondered what strange chance had brought them into that remote sparely peopled valley; they were plainly exiles, and conscious exiles, from the movement and exhilarations of a fuller social life. But Catherine impressed you as only a refined variety of the local type; you could have found many like her, in a sense, among the sweet-faced serious women of the neighbouring farms. Now, as she and Rose stood together, her hand still resting lightly on the other's shoulder, a question from Agnes banished the faint smile on her lips, and left only the look of inward illumination, the expression of one who had just passed, as it were, through a strenuous and heroic moment of life, and was still living in the exaltation of memory. ‘So the poor fellow is worse?’ ‘Yes. Doctor Baker, whom they have got to-day, says the spine is hopelessly injured. He may live on paralysed for a few months or longer, but there is no hope of cure.’ Both girls uttered a shocked exclamation. ‘That fine strong young man!’ said Rose under her breath. ‘Does he know?’ ‘Yes; when I got there the doctor had just gone, and Mrs. Tyson, who was quite unprepared for anything so dreadful, seemed to have almost lost her wits, poor thing! I found her in the front kitchen with her apron over her head, rocking to and fro, and poor Arthur in the inner room—all alone—waiting in suspense.’ ‘And who told him? He has been so hopeful.’ ‘I did,’ said Catherine gently; ‘they made me. He would know, and she couldn't—she ran out of the room. I never saw anything so pitiful.’ ‘Oh, Catherine!’ exclaimed Rose's moved voice, while Agnes got up, and Chattie jumped softly down from her lap, unheeded. ‘How did he bear it?’ ‘Don't ask me,’ said Catherine, while the quiet tears filled her eyes and her voice broke, as the hidden feeling would have its way. ‘It was terrible! I don't know how we got through that half-hour—his mother and I. It was like wrestling with some one in agony. At last he was exhausted—he let me say the Lord's Prayer; I think it soothed him, but one couldn't tell. He seemed half asleep when I left. Oh!’ she cried, laying her hand in a close grasp on Rose's arm, ‘if you had seen his eyes, and his poor hands—there was such despair in them! They say, though he was so young, he was thinking of getting married; and he was so steady, such a good son!’ A silence fell upon the three. Catherine stood looking out across the valley towards the sunset. Now that the demand upon her for calmness and fortitude was removed, and that the religious exaltation in which she had gone through the last three hours was becoming less intense, the pure human pity of the scene she had just witnessed seemed to be gaining upon her. Her lip trembled, and two or three tears silently overflowed."

And that after the divorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream.’ The gate of Mrs. Edlin's cottage clicked, and somebody began crossing in the direction of the school. Phillotson said ‘Good-night.’ ‘O, is that Mr. Phillotson,’ said Mrs. Edlin. ‘I was going over to see 'ee. I've been upstairs with her, helping her to unpack her things; and upon my word, sir, I don't think this ought to be!’ ‘What—the wedding?’ ‘Yes. She's forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and you've no notion what she's suffering. I was never much for religion nor against it, but it can't be right to let her do this, and you ought to persuade her out of it. Of course everybody will say it was very good and forgiving of 'ee to take her to 'ee again. But for my part I don't.’ ‘It's her wish, and I am willing,’ said Phillotson with grave reserve, opposition making him illogically tenacious now. ‘A great piece of laxity will be rectified.’ ‘I don't believe it. She's his wife if anybody's. She's had three children by him, and he loves her dearly; and it's a wicked shame to egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! She's got nobody on her side. The one man who'd be her friend the obstinate creature won't allow to come near her. What first put her into this mood o' mind, I wonder!’ ‘I can't tell. Not I certainly. It is all voluntary on her part. Now that's all I have to say.’ Phillotson spoke stiffly. ‘You've turned round, Mrs. Edlin. It is unseemly of you!’ ‘Well. I knowed you'd be affronted at what I had to say; but I don't mind that. The truth's the truth.’ ‘I'm not affronted, Mrs. Edlin. You've been too kind a neighbour for that. But I must be allowed to know what's best for myself and Susanna. I suppose you won't go to church with us, then?’ ‘No. Be hanged if I can. ... I don't know what the times be coming to! Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really do feel afeard to move in it at all. In my time we took it more careless; and I don't know that we was any the worse for it! When I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketting all the week, and drunk the parish dry, and had to borrow half-a-crown to begin housekeeping!’ When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson spoke moodily. ‘I don't know whether I ought to do it—at any rate quite so rapidly.’ ‘Why?’ ‘If she is really compelling herself to this against her instincts—merely from this new sense of duty or religion—I ought perhaps to let her wait a bit.’ ‘Now you've got so far you ought not to back out of it. That's my opinion.’"
doc10= "full gallop. They encountered no timid enemy. The large body which they charged, consisted (excepting some mounted officers) entirely of infantry, who, setting the but of their lances against their feet, the front rank kneeling, the second stooping, and those behind presenting their spears over their heads, offering such resistance to the rapid charge of the men-at-arms as the hedge-hog presents to his enemy. Few were able to make way through that iron wall; but of those few was Dunois, who, giving spur to his horse, and making the noble animal leap more than twelve feet at a bound, fairly broke his way into the middle of the phalanx, and made towards the object of his animosity. What was his surprise to find Quentin still by his side, and fighting in the same front with himself—youth, desperate courage, and the determination to do or die, having still kept the youth abreast with the best knight in Europe; for such was Dunois reported, and truly reported, at the period. Their spears were soon broken; but the lanzknechts were unable to withstand the blows of their long heavy swords; while the horses and riders, armed in complete steel, sustained little injury from their lances. Still Dunois and Durward were contending with rival efforts to burst forward to the spot where he who had usurped the armorial bearings of Dunois was doing the duty of a good and valiant leader, when Dunois, observing the boar's-head and tusks—the usual bearing of William de la Marck—in another part of the conflict, called out to Quentin, “Thou art worthy to avenge the arms of Orleans! I leave thee the task.—Balafré, support your nephew; but let none dare to interfere with Dunois' boar-hunt!” That Quentin Durward joyfully acquiesced in this division of labour cannot be doubted, and each pressed forward upon his separate object, followed, and defended from behind, by such men-at-arms as were able to keep up with them. But at this moment the column which De la Marck had proposed to support, when his own course was arrested by the charge of Dunois, had lost all the advantages they had gained during the night; while the Burgundians, with returning day, had begun to show the qualities which belong to superior discipline. The great mass of Liegeois were compelled to retreat, and at length to fly; and, falling back on those who were engaged with the French men-at-arms, the whole became a confused tide of fighters, fliers, and pursuers, which rolled itself towards the city-walls, and at last was poured into the ample and undefended breach through which the Liegeois had sallied. Quentin made more than human exertions to overtake the special object of his pursuit, who was still in his sight, striving, by voice and example, to renew the battle, and bravely supported by a chosen party of lanzknechts. Le Balafré, and several of his comrades, attached themselves to Quentin, much marvelling at the extraordinary gallantry displayed by so young a soldier. On the very"
